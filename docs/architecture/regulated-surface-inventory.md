# Regulated Surface Inventory

Canonical registry of all Phlo surfaces and their regulated-access classification.
Source of truth for `phlo.security.gating`.

## Enforcement Layers

The platform enforces access across four layers, not just at the UI/API boundary:

| Layer | Surfaces | Enforcement mechanism |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Control-plane enforced | phlo-api, CLI, Dagster webserver | Phlo `enforce()` at request boundary |
| Autonomous execution | Dagster daemon (schedules, sensors) | Platform principal (`platform:dagster-daemon`) + run-level audit |
| Data-plane governed | Trino, PostgreSQL, MinIO, Nessie | Compiled RBAC applied to backend-native auth; verified at startup |
| Ingress-gated read surfaces | Hasura, PostgREST, Superset | Ingress auth + compiled read-only permissions; writes blocked by default |
| Inherited protection | Observatory, dbt/dlt/sling libraries | Protected by upstream enforced surfaces |
| Blocked | pgweb, OpenMetadata (direct) | Startup gating prevents use |

### Principal Types

| Type | Subject pattern | When used |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| `user` | `alice@example.com` | Human via IdP/proxy/JWT |
| `service` | `service:phlo-api` | Named service calling another service |
| `platform` | `platform:dagster-daemon` | Autonomous execution with no contemporaneous human request |

## Classification Tiers

| Tier | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Required direct surfaces | User/operator entrypoints; need `regulated_surface` adapters |
| 2 | Ingress-controlled surfaces | Browser-facing; protected upstream by ingress + regulated API |
| 3 | Backend-governed services | No request-time adapter; governed by compiled RBAC artifacts |
| 4 | Internal ops tools with CLIs | Operational tooling; backend-only access |
| 5 | Plugin/indirect packages | No direct entrypoint; reached only through already-regulated surfaces |

## Validation Report Fields

Per-surface fields reported by `run_regulated_validation`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `surface_type` | API, CLI, Web UI, backend, plugin |
| `enforcement_mode` | `regulated_surface` adapter, compiler-only, ingress-controlled, N/A |
| `identity_source` | Where the principal comes from |
| `audit_path` | How audit events are emitted |
| `policy_source` | Where authorization policy comes from |
| `direct_exposure` | Whether the surface is directly exposed to users/operators |

## Relationship to `phlo.security.gating`

The four frozensets in `gating.py` map to this inventory:

- **`UNSUPPORTED_SERVICES`**: Surfaces blocked in regulated mode (pgweb, openmetadata variants)
- **`PENDING_ADAPTER_SERVICES`**: Surfaces with adapters pending approval (none currently)
- **`INGRESS_OPTIONAL_SERVICES`**: Surfaces allowed only with ingress + upstream auth protection (hasura, postgrest, superset). Logs a warning but does not block.
- **`APPROVED_SERVICES`**: Surfaces fully allowed in regulated mode (phlo-api, dagster-*, cli, backends, observatory)

`INGRESS_OPTIONAL_SERVICES` surfaces log a warning in regulated mode but are not blocked.
They require a documented ingress boundary to be considered regulated-ready.

The inventory is the authoritative classification; `gating.py` is the runtime enforcement.
